## Part 7: Answering Questions About the Code

1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Fibonacci fails the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test because it includes 0 in the
first if statement which will throw new IllegalArgumentException with the statement "0 is
negative" when it evaluates zero, which is incorrect. So to fix this issue, I had to change the
condition to n < 0.


2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Fibonacci fails the testBaseCase test for the same reason described in question 1. The original
codes throw an exception when it encounters zero when it should have returned 1. By removing "="
in the first if statement, it is able to enter the second if statement, which will then return 1.


3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

It fails the testInductiveCase test for including 2 in the base case. When n = 2, it should enter
the recursive call in the last if statement and return 1 + 1 = 2. To fix this issue, I had to
remove the "=" from "n <= 2" so that it will enter the last if statement and return the correct
output.


## Part 8: Debugger Tutorial

1. What are the values of "x", "y", and "sum" printed by your statement? Why was x not equal 
to the first integer entered here, and how could we fix this?

The value of "x" printed is 4, "y" is 4, and the sum is 0. x is not equal to the first
integer entered because the integer is divided by 2 (result: 5 / 2 = 2) and then multiplied
by 2, which eliminates the decimals during the division. To fix this, we can simply receive
the entered value as is, which is "console.nextInt()".


2. What are all the names and values listed in the “Variables” panel? What does the “frames” 
tab list as the current method and line number? (Write down the text that was highlighted when
the Debug perspective first opened.)

In the "Variables" panel, there are "x = 5" and "y = 4". The current method is "computeSum" at
line 45.


3. What are all the names and values listed in the “Variables” panel after each of the two step overs?

The names and values are "x" = 5, "y" = 4, and "sum" = 1.
