## CSE 331 HW6 Questions

NOTE: This file is used as part of HW6, and is not due as part of the HW5
submission. You may leave it blank for HW5.

## Part 1

A few examples of possible Graph representations:

    A: A collection of nodes and a collection of edges.
    B: An adjacency list, in which each node is associated with a list of its outgoing edges.
    C: An adjacency matrix, which explicitly represents, for every pair ⟨A,B⟩ of nodes, whether there 
       is a link from A to B, and how many.

1. In two or three sentences, explain an advantage and a disadvantage of each of the
representations listed above (for example, in terms of runtime complexity, space
complexity, or ease of implementation).

A:
B: An advantage using adjacency list is the reduce of memory usage, for it stores information in
    a two-dimensional array.
C: One advantage using this is that it works better in storing constant factors as matrices.
   But a disadvantage is that the space complexity for a adjacency matrix is n * n which is higher
    than that of an adjacency list.



2. In two to three sentences, describe the representation you chose and explain why you
chose it. If you chose to use a different representation than one of the three we described
above, be sure to list its advantages and disadvantages, too.

    (Please keep your answers brief and to-the-point.)

1. Describe any new tests you added and why you added them, or why you feel that your original
tests alone are sufficient.




2. Did you make any changes to your specifications as you were implementing your Graph? (yes/no)
If yes, describe your changes and why you made them.
